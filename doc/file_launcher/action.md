## Action

The action system in IDEA allows plugins to add their own actions in menus and toolbars. An example of an action included in IDEA is the `File| Open File...` .

For our plugin we will define actions to launch the current file in the GNU-Prolog interpreter, this interpreter will run in the IDEA console window.
