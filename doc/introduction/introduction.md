# IntelliProlog Introduction

This chapter will discuss the global structure of this report concerning the development of an
IntelliJ plugin for the programming language Prolog, specifically the GNU Prolog @gprolog-website
implementation developed by Daniel Diaz.

## Introduction

This report will be structured as a tutorial for developing a custom language plugin for the
IntelliJ platform.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is that in the Logical Programming course at the Applied Sciences University of 
Fribourg, students learn to program in GNU Prolog. 

More and more students are using IntelliJ or other IDEs developed by JetBrains for their development needs and for the
moment there does not exist a good way to write and run GNU Prolog code in IntelliJ. 

A previous project developed a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, but since that IDE is used less and less nowadays, the
decision was taken to start a new project to develop a plugin for IntelliJ and possibly other variants of IDES
developed by JetBrains.
