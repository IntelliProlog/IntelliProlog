## GNU-Prolog

GNU Prolog is a Prolog implementation, constisting mainly of a compiler, developed by
Daniel Diaz [@DanDi] an associate professor at the
Panth√©on Sorbonne University of Paris [@PSUP].

It conforms to ISO Prolog and adds a constraint solver over Finite Domains.

The features available in GNU Prolog are:

+ Compile our source code to abstract machine code to run on a
  Warren Abstract Machine [@WAM].
+ Native interfacing with the C programming language, there also exists
  GNU Prolog for Java [@GPROJ]
+ Interactive interpreter, allows us to consult Prolog and run them interactively.

It does not provide support for Unicode encoding or object-orientated elements but can be added with
Logtalk which we will see shortly.
