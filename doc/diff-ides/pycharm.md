## PyCharm

The PyCharm IDE is based on the IntelliJ IDEA Community edition IDE with a Python overlay. It also has two versions, Community and Ultimate editions, like IntelliJ IDEA.

The PyCharm IDEs have the basic modules as defined in the introduction, as well as the database modules `com.intellij.modules.database` and python modules `com.intellij.modules.python`.

Another difference between PyCharm and the IntelliJ IDEA IDEs, is that the non-IDEA IDEs have a simplified project creation method (`Open Directory`).
