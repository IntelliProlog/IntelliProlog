## SWI-Prolog

SWI-Prolog is a Prolog implementation, developed by
Jan Wielemaker [@JWIEL] a researcher at the
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam [@VUNL].

It conforms to ISO Prolog as well Edinburgh Prolog.

The features available in SWI-Prolog are:

+ Compiles the source code to abstract machine code to run on a
   Warren Abstract Machine [@WAM].
+ Support for Unicode encoding.
+ Native interfacing with C programming language and Java through the
  JPL package [@JPLP]
+ Interactive interpreter, allows us to consult Prolog and run them interactively.

As with GNU Prolog, SWI-Prolog does not support object-orientated elements but can be added with
Logtalk.

SWI-Prolog also has a built-in editor, PCeEmacs, and a lot of extra functionality can be added
through its package system.
