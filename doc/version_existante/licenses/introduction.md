# Quick overview of the different licenses for software

Licenses are an integral part of any software project and because of this we thought we
should cover some of these licenses and their differences.

## Introduction

Understanding what a license means and the impact it will have on our software is very difficult to
understand unless we were a lawyer. To remedy the problem of understanding these licenses there are
a couple of websites that give quick summaries and checklists what a license allows, disallows and
enforces. The websites are Choose a License [@CAL] and tl;dr Legal [@TLDR].

For our project we have chosen to use a Apache 2.0 License, since the IntelliJ Platform SDK and most
of the plugins developed for IntelliJ use this license.

Next we will do a quick overview of the Apache 2.0 License as well as the MIT License.
