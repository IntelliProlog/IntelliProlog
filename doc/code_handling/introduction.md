# Code handling

Code handling is a very big part of any IDE and Jetbrains IDEs are well known to have some of the best
code handling.

## Introduction

In this section we will cover some of the more basic code handling aspects, commenting and code folding.

These features are more visual than other code handling features but are still very useful since they
allow programmers to reduce the visual clutter of the source code. Visual clutter can be very distracting
when writing bigger and more complicated programs, especially if the files are also very big.

Other code handling features that we envisioned of implementing but did not for different reasons
mainly lack of time, are:

+ Refactoring
+ Code completion
+ Find Usages

The implementations of these features are taken from the [Logtalk IDEA plugin](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/coding/idea).

Without further ado, let us start with commenting.
