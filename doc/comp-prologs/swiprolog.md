## SWI-Prolog

SWI-Prolog is a Prolog implementation, developed by
[Jan Wielemaker](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/jan-wielemaker) a researcher at the
[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/).

It conforms to ISO Prolog as well Edinburgh Prolog.

The features available in SWI-Prolog are:

+ Compiles the source code to abstract machine code to run on a
  [Warren Abstract Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine).
+ Support for Unicode encoding.
+ Native interfacing with C programming language and Java through the
  [JPL package](http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/jpl/)
+ Interactive interpreter, allows us to consult Prolog and run them interactively.

As with GNU Prolog, SWI-Prolog does not support object-orientated elements but can be added with
Logtalk.

SWI-Prolog also has a built-in editor, PCeEmacs, and a lot of extra functionality can be added
through its package system.
