## LogTalk

[Logtalk](https://logtalk.org/logtalk.html) is a Prolog implementation with object-oriented features
that extends other Prolog implementations, using their compiler as its back-end compiler. It was
created by Paulo Moura.

It's features will be dependant on the Prolog implementation used as the back-end compiler.
